Spammify
=======

Email address got inadvertently disclosed and got lots of junk traffic coming in while the built-in spam filter did not work as expected. So I built my own spam fighting engine to spamify "legit" emails. This works at a background service that profiles an IMAP-enabled Inbox and predicts Spam level based on what it learns from a known set of junk emails.
